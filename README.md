POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
{
"email": "user@example.com",
"password": "yourpassword"
}
```


#### User Login
```bash
http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{
"email": "user@example.com",
"password": "yourpassword"
}
```


#### Get All Users (Admin Only)

http
GET /auth/users
Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}
```


## 🔒 Security Implementation

- JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Secure flag enabled for HTTPS-only transmission
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
- 24-hour token expiration
- Stateless authentication architecture
- Password encryption using BCrypt

## 🔧 Configuration

The application can be configured through `application.properties` or environment variables:

- `SERVER_PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation
- `JWT_EXPIRATION`: Token expiration time in milliseconds

### CORS Configuration

The application is configured to accept requests from the following origins in development:
- `http://localhost:3000` (React default port)
- `http://localhost:4200` (Angular default port)

To add additional origins or modify CORS settings, update the `CorsConfig.java` file.

For production, make sure to:
1. Replace the allowed origins with your production domain
2. Remove any development-only origins
3. Consider implementing more restrictive CORS policies
